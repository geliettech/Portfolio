                Hi üëã! I'm Ogechi Juliet Uhegbu, also known as OGE. I‚Äôm deeply
                passionate about technology, which led me to earn a BSc in
                Computer Science & Informatics. This academic journey equipped
                me with a solid foundation in programming, web development,
                software engineering principles, and problem-solving. I
                specialize in building responsive, accessible, and user-friendly
                web interfaces using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                React, TypeScript, and Next.js‚Äîskills I honed through the Stutern
                Accelerator and continuous self-learning. I‚Äôve contributed to
                projects across diverse sectors, including architecture,
                textiles, and women‚Äôs charities, focusing on intuitive and
                engaging user experiences. As a committed lifelong learner, I
                actively explore new technologies, frameworks, and best
                practices. My growth mindset enables me to adapt quickly, solve
                complex problems creatively, and thrive in fast-paced
                environments. I genuinely enjoy collaborating with designers,
                backend developers, and cross-functional teams to bring ideas to
                life. My development approach emphasizes clarity, teamwork, and
                empathy. Fun Facts About Me: üöÄI love space, JavaScript,
                React.js, teamwork, and family time. ‚ùåI dislike comparison,
                lateness, and procrastination. Long-Term Goal: To become a
                well-rounded software developer, capable of building scalable
                applications that solve real-world problems and improve everyday
                life.
